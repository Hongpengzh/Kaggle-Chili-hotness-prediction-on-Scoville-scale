## Background
A large-scale grocery retailer imports chili from all over the world. The imported chilies have different levels of hotness and need to be distributed to different customers across the country. In order to further automate the distribution process to the customers a machine learning model is needed that can predict the hotness of each chili in a rapid manner based on a number of measurements done on the chili without involving human tasting.

The large-scale grocery retailer measures a number of properties of the chili (see data description) which also requires resources. Can the model be trained on fewer features and provide good performance to save further resources and stop doing unnecessary measurements?

## Data description
* index: unique identifier

* Time storage: duration of storage [days]
* Protein density: measured in [mg/kg]
* Fibre density: measured in [g/kg]
* Capsaicin level: measured in [mg/kg]
* Dihydrocapsaicin level: measured in [mg/kg]
* Saturated fatty acids: measured in [mg/dL]
* Monounsaturated fatty acids: measured in [mg/dL]
* Polyunsaturated fatty acids: measured in [mg/dL]
* Light transmittance: measured in [%]
* Water: water content measured in [%]
* Pungent odor: measured on an intensity scale from 1 to 9
* Vitamin C: vitamin C level measured in [µg/kg]
* Scoville score (target): hotness intensity on Scoville scale
